/* 
Conversion Logic:
1. The stored procedure's parameters are converted into variables using dbt's `var` function.
2. The `WITH` clause `variables` CTE is used to define these variables.
3. The actual procedure logic needs to be added in place of the `policy_hist` CTE as per the original procedure requirements.
4. The procedural code is adapted to fit within dbt's SQL model framework.
5. Snowflake's SQL dialect is used as specified in the metadata.

```

### Explanation

1. **Meta Information**: The metadata from the input JSON is included in the `meta` dictionary within the `config` block to capture the relevant conversion details and maintain traceability.

2. **Variable Handling**: The stored procedure parameters are translated into dbt variables using dbt's `var` function. This allows you to pass these variables when building the model in dbt.

3. **CTE Structure**: A `WITH` clause (CTE) is used to declare and use the variables, setting a foundation for further logic that would be implemented based on the procedure's requirements.

4. **Materialization and Model Configuration**: The model is configured with `materialized='ephemeral'`, as the logic here is part of a conversion from a procedure which might not directly produce a table or view. Adjust this materialization based on the actual output requirements.

5. **SQL Comments**: Existing SQL comments are preserved as per your instructions, and additional comments are added to explain the conversion logic.

6. **Dialect and Runner**: The model specifies Snowflake SQL as the output dialect, consistent with the input dialect, and acknowledges Azure Data Factory as the stored procedure runner.

This conversion provides a framework to integrate procedural logic into dbt, with placeholders for specific transformations and operations that would be present in the original Azure Data Factory procedure.
